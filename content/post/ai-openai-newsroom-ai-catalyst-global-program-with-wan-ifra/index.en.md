WAN-IFRA, the World Association of News Publishers, has announced today the launch of a broad-based accelerator program for over 100 news publishers in partnership with OpenAI. The Newsroom AI Catalyst is an accelerator program designed to help newsrooms fast-track their AI adoption and implementation to bring efficiencies and create quality content. 

The era of AI and especially generative AI brings significant opportunities for newsrooms and publishers: AI can assist in creating and improving content or help to do deeper analysis of information and data. It can also enhance the user experience on news websites. Newsrooms also use AI to find new formats for delivering information. But there are at the same time new challenges for journalists, publishers and society like a potential growth and spread of misinformation and topics around privacy, copyright, bias and others.The Newsroom AI Catalyst accelerator program will assist 128 newsrooms across Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and South Asia. This intensive program combines expert guidance with hands-on experience, equipping newsroom stakeholders with the knowledge and tools needed to drive strategic AI initiatives. OpenAI, the AI research and deployment company behind ChatGPT, is funding and providing technical assistance to the initiative. 

“News enterprises across the globe have come under pressure from declining advertising and print subscription revenues. The adversity confronting news leaves communities without access to a shared basis of facts and shared values, and puts democracy itself at risk. AI technologies have the potential to positively influence the sustainability of news organisations.” said Vincent Peyregne, CEO of WAN-IFRA. “I am delighted by the support of OpenAI to help the newsrooms through adoption of AI technologies to provide high-quality journalism that is the corner stone of news business” he added. 

“At OpenAI, we are committed to harnessing the transformative power of AI to expand opportunities broadly. This program is designed to turbocharge the capabilities of 128 newsrooms across Europe, Asia and Latin America in collaboration with WAN-IFRA,” said Tom Rubin, Chief of Intellectual Property and Content at OpenAI.  “We are excited to collaborate with WAN-IFRA and news publishers around the world to cultivate a healthy, sustainable ecosystem that promotes  quality journalism.” 

## Program outline and outcomes
The accelerator program with a duration of three months per team includes learning modules, hands-on workshops, a mini hackathon and a show case. The program will start with an in-person workshop for the participants and coaches to get to know each other and kick start the AI prototyping project. Participants will leave the program with a clear idea and plans on how to rollout AI in their newsroom.

More details about the program, the curriculum, the timeline, eligibility and the application process will soon be available at www.wan-ifra.org
