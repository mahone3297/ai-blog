Vox Media, the leader in modern media, today announced a broad-based strategic partnership with OpenAI in which Vox Media’s respected portfolio of properties including Vox, The Verge, Eater, New York Magazine, The Cut, Vulture, and SB Nation, will help inform ChatGPT’s 100 million users, receiving brand attribution and audience referrals. The two companies will also collaborate using OpenAI’s technology to develop innovative products for Vox Media’s consumers and advertising partners.

Through this partnership, ChatGPT and future products will draw upon the trusted journalism and expertise of Vox Media’s award-winning media properties. Additionally, OpenAI will enhance its technology with Vox Media’s archives, which contain a deep well of reliable and accountable information and journalism. This agreement recognizes the value of the company’s work and intellectual property, while opening it up to new audiences and better informing the public.

Since its founding in 2011, Vox Media has continuously developed and embraced new technologies that benefit its users across platforms; this new partnership will boost the company’s ability to innovate with generative AI. As part of the agreement, Vox Media will work with OpenAI, leveraging its technology to build audience-facing and internal applications and capabilities. OpenAI technology will help to support discovery of valuable recommendations and information for consumers from Vox Media’s brands. Among other uses, Vox Media will continue to enhance its affiliate commerce product, The Strategist Gift Scout, which acts as a super-charged search tool, matching shoppers with the perfect Strategist-endorsed gift using OpenAI tools.

Vox Media will also use OpenAI technology to extend the leadership of Forte, its first-party data platform. Launched in 2019, Forte was purposefully built to drive outcomes for advertisers, with its targeted impressions earning 2x the performance compared to alternative data sources. The platform is available across all Vox Media sites and Vox Media’s ad marketplace, Concert. Advertisers will benefit from the OpenAI partnership through even stronger creative optimization and audience segment targeting, leading to even higher campaign performance.

“We’re thrilled to partner with OpenAI. This agreement aligns with our goals of leveraging generative AI to innovate for our audiences and customers, protect and grow the value of our work and intellectual property, and boost productivity and discoverability to elevate the talent and creativity of our exceptional journalists and creators,” said Jim Bankoff, co-founder, chair and CEO of Vox Media.

“As the media and technology landscapes change, it’s vital that accurate, trustworthy information reaches the public, and this partnership recognizes that human creativity and quality journalism are a key part of responsible deployment of generative AI,” said Pam Wasserstein, president of Vox Media.

"We're excited to partner with Vox Media to give our audiences the best experiences at the intersection of AI and media. Working together, we can drive forward with innovation while amplifying the work of journalists," said Brad Lightcap, COO, OpenAI.
