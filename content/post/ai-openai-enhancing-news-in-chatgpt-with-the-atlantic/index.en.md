Today The Atlantic is announcing a strategic content and product partnership with OpenAI, which positions The Atlantic as a premium news source within OpenAI. The Atlantic’s articles will be discoverable within OpenAI’s products, including ChatGPT, and as a partner, The Atlantic will help to shape how news is surfaced and presented in future real-time discovery products. Queries that surface The Atlantic will include attribution and a link to read the full article on theatlantic.com(opens in a new window).

As part of this agreement, The Atlantic and OpenAI are also collaborating on product and tech: The Atlantic’s product team will have privileged access to OpenAI tech, give feedback, and share use-cases to shape and improve future news experiences in ChatGPT and other OpenAI products. The Atlantic is currently developing an experimental microsite, called Atlantic Labs, to figure out how AI can help in the development of new products and features to better serve its journalism and readers––and will pilot OpenAI’s and other emerging tech into this work.

“We believe that people searching with AI models will be one of the fundamental ways that people navigate the web in the future,” said Nicholas Thompson, The Atlantic’s CEO. “We’re delighted to partner with OpenAI, to make The Atlantic’s reporting and stories more discoverable to their millions of users, and to have a voice in shaping how news is surfaced on their platforms.”

"Enabling access to The Atlantic’s reporting in our products will allow users to more deeply interact with thought-provoking news. We are dedicated to supporting high quality journalism and the publishing ecosystem," said Brad Lightcap, OpenAI COO. 

The Atlantic is maximizing ambition as it continues to pair journalistic excellence with growth across the company––building on the recently announced milestones of surpassing 1 million subscriptions and reaching profitability(opens in a new window). It is pursuing partnerships, like that with OpenAI, that recognize the enormous value of The Atlantic’s independent journalism and storytelling, and that responsibly pursue new reader growth and discoverability. In April, for the third consecutive year, The Atlantic was awarded the top honor(opens in a new window) of General Excellence at the 2024 National Magazine Awards, the most prestigious category in the annual honors from the American Society of Magazine Editors, and won three separate reporting awards. The magazine earned its first Pulitzer Prizes in 2021, 2022, and 2023 for stories that exemplify the depth and range of its journalism.
