## Summary

By building AI right into the Android operating system, Google is reimagining how users can interact with their phones. The latest updates include Circle to Search for homework help, enhanced Gemini assistant capabilities, and real-time scam detection during phone calls. Circle to Search now assists students with step-by-step instructions for solving math and physics problems, and it will soon handle more complex problems. Gemini is becoming better at understanding context to assist users in various tasks, and it will roll out to hundreds of millions of devices. Additionally, Gemini Nano's multimodal capabilities will bring clearer descriptions to TalkBack for visually impaired users. The new scam detection feature uses Gemini Nano to alert users during calls if scam patterns are detected.
