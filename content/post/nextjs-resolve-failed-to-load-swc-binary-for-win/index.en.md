When running the Next.js `npm run dev` command, you might encounter this frustrating error:

```bash
Failed to load SWC binary for win32/64 (Next.js)
next-swc.win32-x64-msvc.node is not a valid Win32 application.
```

Don't worry, it's not the end of the world! The official documentation has provided a detailed solution. Today, I'll walk you through how to resolve this tricky issue.

## First, Identify the Root Cause

This error is mainly due to the missing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable components. You can download and install it from the [Microsoft website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170).

## Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. Confirm Your Processor Architecture

In the Windows system, confirming your processor architecture is very simple. Just follow these steps:
- Open the "Settings" app (you can quickly open it by pressing Win + I).
- Go to "System" > "About".
- In the "Device specifications" section, look for "System type". You will see a description like "64-bit operating system, x64-based processor" or "64-bit operating system, ARM64-based processor".

This way, you will know whether your processor is x64 or ARM64.

### 2. Check Node Process Architecture

Next, make sure that your Node process architecture matches your processor architecture. Open the Command Prompt (cmd) and enter the following command:

```bash
node -p "process.arch"
```

You will see a result like `x64` or `arm64`.

### 3. Install the Correct SWC Package

Based on your processor architecture, run the following command to reinstall the appropriate SWC package:

```bash
npm i @next/swc-win32-x64-msvc
```

## All Done

Now, you can run `npm run dev` again and see if the error is resolved. If everything goes smoothly, your Next.js project should start without any issues!
