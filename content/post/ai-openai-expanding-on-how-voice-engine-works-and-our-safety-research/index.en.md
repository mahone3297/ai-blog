This article discusses the working principle and safety research of the voice engine developed by OpenAI. The voice engine is a text-to-speech (TTS) model that can generate human-like audio from just text and a 15-second sample of speech. The model is developed by understanding the nuances of paired audio and transcribed speech, and it can generate speech that reflects how different types of speakers would pronounce the text. OpenAI first developed the voice engine at the end of 2022 and conducted internal tests to evaluate its capabilities and limitations. Additionally, OpenAI has been communicating with partners in government, media, entertainment, education, and other fields to ensure their feedback is incorporated into the construction process, and multiple safety measures have been implemented.
