An affordable offering for universities to responsibly bring AI to campus.

We're announcing ChatGPT Edu, a version of ChatGPT built for universities to responsibly deploy AI to students, faculty, researchers, and campus operations. Powered by GPT-4o, ChatGPT Edu can reason across text and vision and use advanced tools such as data analysis. This new offering includes enterprise-level security and controls and is affordable for educational institutions. 

We built ChatGPT Edu because we saw the success universities like the University of Oxford, Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania(opens in a new window), University of Texas at Austin, Arizona State University(opens in a new window), and Columbia University in the City of New York were having with ChatGPT Enterprise.

## How campuses use ChatGPT today
ChatGPT can help with various tasks across campus, such as providing personalized tutoring for students and reviewing their resumes, helping researchers write grant applications, and assisting faculty with grading and feedback. Our university partners have found innovative ways to make AI accessible to students, faculty, researchers, and campus operations. A few examples include:

- Professor Nabila El-Bassel at Columbia University is leading an initiative to integrate AI into community-based strategies to reduce overdose fatalities(opens in a new window). Her team built a GPT that analyzes and synthesizes large datasets to inform interventions, reducing weeks of research work into seconds.
- Undergraduates and MBA students in Professor Ethan Mollick’s courses at Wharton completed their final reflection assignments through discussions with a GPT trained on course materials, reporting that ChatGPT got them to think more deeply about what they’ve learned.
- Christiane Reves, an assistant professor at Arizona State University, is developing a custom Language Buddies GPT for students(opens in a new window) to engage in German conversations suited to their language level while receiving tailored feedback. The GPT will help students build communication skills and save faculty time on assessments.

## Bringing AI into the new school year
To build on these applications, we designed ChatGPT Edu as an accessible option for universities to bring AI to their campuses at scale. 

ChatGPT Edu includes:

- Access to GPT-4o, our flagship model, excelling in text interpretation, coding, and mathematics
- Advanced capabilities such as data analytics, web browsing, and document summarization
- The ability to build GPTs, custom versions of ChatGPT, and share them within university workspaces
- Significantly higher message limits than the free version of ChatGPT
- Improved language capabilities across quality and speed, with over 50 languages supported
- Robust security, data privacy, and administrative controls such as group permissions, SSO, SCIM 1, and GPT management
- Conversations and data are not used to train OpenAI models

>“Integrating OpenAI's technology into our educational and operational frameworks accelerates transformation at ASU. We're collaborating across our community to harness these tools, extending our learnings as a scalable model for other institutions.”
>
>—Kyle Bowen, Deputy CIO at Arizona State University

ChatGPT Edu is designed for schools that want to deploy AI more broadly to students and their campus communities. Contact our team to learn more.
