Gemini for Google Workspace helps people and businesses get more out of their Google apps — from drafting emails in Gmail to organizing project plans in Sheets. Over the last year, more than a million people and tens of thousands of companies have used generative AI in Workspace when they need an extra hand or dose of inspiration.

Today we’re announcing new ways to get more done in your personal and professional life with Gemini for Google Workspace. Gemini in the Workspace side panel now uses Gemini 1.5 Pro and is coming to more people. We’re also adding new features to Gemini in Gmail on mobile and expanding language support for Help me write in Docs and Gmail.

## 1. Access Gemini 1.5 Pro in the side panel of Workspace apps
Starting today, Gemini in the side panel of Gmail, Docs, Drive, Slides and Sheets will use Gemini 1.5 Pro. With a longer context window and more advanced reasoning, Gemini can answer a wider variety of questions and provide more insightful responses. Plus, it's easy to get started with summaries that will appear in the side panel, suggested prompts and more.

Thanks to the longer context window, Gemini can reference much larger sets of data. So if your child’s school sends a flood of emails each month, you’ll be able to use the side panel in Gmail to ask things like, “summarize the emails from Maywood Park Elementary School” and instantly get the most important details and action items. Need to share hotel details for the family reunion? Simply type @ in the Gmail side panel to find the right document in your Drive, then ask Gemini for the name of the hotel and the sales manager’s contact information. Then you can easily insert the results into an email so your family members have the details they need.

Gemini in the Workspace side panel is now available for Workspace Labs and Gemini for Workspace Alpha users. It will be available next month on desktop for businesses and consumers through Gemini for Workspace add-ons and the Google One AI Premium plan.

## 2. Try new Gemini for Workspace features in the Gmail mobile app
We’re also launching new features in the Gmail mobile app to help you easily access Gemini and stay productive on the go.

- Summarize emails: Catching up on long email threads can be time-consuming from any device, but it’s especially challenging on small screens. With this feature, Gemini can analyze email threads and provide a summarized view directly in the Gmail app. Simply tap the summarize button at the top of your email thread to get the highlights. This will be available to Workspace Labs users this month, and to all Gemini for Workspace customers and Google One AI Premium subscribers next month.
- Contextual Smart Reply: For years, Gmail users have saved time with suggested responses from Smart Reply, as-you-type suggestions from Smart Compose, and entire email drafts from Help me write. Soon, Gemini in Gmail will offer even more detailed and nuanced suggested replies based on context from your email thread. With Contextual Smart Reply, you can edit or simply send as-is. This will be available to Workspace Labs users on mobile and web starting in July.
- Gmail Q&A: Soon when you click the new Gemini icon in the mobile app, Gemini in Gmail will offer helpful options, like “summarize this email,” “list the next steps” or “suggest a reply.” And similar to the side panel on desktop, you can use the open prompt box when you have more specific requests. For instance, you could ask Gemini to “find the bid from the roofing contractor” that’s buried somewhere in your inbox. Or maybe you don’t want to dig through your Drive for the document with details about your book club. Instead, you could just ask Gemini, “What are the discussion questions for my upcoming book club meeting?” Gmail Q&A will be available to Workspace Labs users on mobile and web starting in July.

## 3. Use Help me write in more languages
We recently announced Translate for me in Google Meet, with automatic language detection and real-time translated captions in more than 60 languages to help people around the world connect. Now we’re adding language support for more Gemini for Workspace features. In the coming weeks, Help me write in Gmail and Docs will support Spanish and Portuguese on desktop. We’ll continue to add more languages over time.

To start using these features and several other newly announced capabilities for the Gemini web and mobile apps, check out the Gemini for Workspace add-ons for business customers and Google One AI Premium plan for consumers.
